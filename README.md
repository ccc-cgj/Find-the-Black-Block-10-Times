Find-the-Black-Block-5-Times
============================
For my dearest Jibber Jabber Specialist

To win, you have to find a black block for 10 times before the time shown on the top runs out. Good luck. 
There are two trickes available for now: 
  if you hit 'A', you get to flash the screen and know where the block is; 
  if you hit 'S', you get a larger flash light radius for a short period of time. 

GLHF.
